# My Compute App

Hiya this is an app that runs at the edge!

Try the app out by opening it in a codespace: 

* Create a fork of this repo
* Click **Code** > **Codespaces**
* Create a codespace on the current branch

Your codespace will perform a few setup tasks including automatically running your new Compute app on a local server – _it might take a couple of minutes to start up._

Once you have your new app open in the preview you can explore the code:

* Your `fastly.toml` file includes the service config
* The `src/index.js` file includes the application logic

Make a change to the `index.js` code! The Fastly CLI will automatically rebuild and run the app – you'll see the effects in the preview.
